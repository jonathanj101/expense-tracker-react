# Summary

Transitioning this previous [project](https://jonathanj101.github.io/Expense-Tracker-App/main.html) built with pure HTML CSS & JavaScript into this Front-End Javascript library React.js, have been a nightmare of mine as far as i can remember when first introduce to me. Dealing with Fuunctional & Class Components, State & Props and maainting a centralize application. After many errors and tons of research solving these errors one by one, giving that "ah ah" moment.Thus, step by step understanding React concepts, making Front-End Web Development much easier one way or another. Furthermore, with the research done, these challenges are worth the while for sure.
